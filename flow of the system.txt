1. RFID Scan

	The RFID reader scans a card.

	The card’s UID is uploaded to the database with a timestamp.

2. Admin Handling for New Users

	Admin manually enters:

		User Name

		User Type (Student, Staff, etc.)

		Department / Class / Section

		Admin saves the entry → database now links UID → User info.

3. Attendance Logging

	Once a UID is registered:

	Every scan automatically logs attendance.

	Log fields:

		UID

		User ID / Name

		Timestamp

		Session type (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)

		Status (Present / Late / Absent)

	Admin can edit logs if there’s a mistake (wrong scan, duplicate, etc.).

4. Reports & Export

	Admin can generate:

		Daily / Weekly / Monthly attendance reports.

		Filter by user, date, session.

		Export to CSV / PDF for record-keeping.
